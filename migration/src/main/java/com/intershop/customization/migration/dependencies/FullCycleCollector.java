/**
 * FullCycleCollector is a utility class that detects cycles in a directed graph
 * represented by a list of strings. Each string should be in the format "from > to",
 * where "from" is the starting node and "to" is the destination node.
 * 
 * This class provides methods to build a directed graph from the input strings,
 * detect cycles using depth-first search, and normalize cycles to avoid duplicates.
 *
 * <p/> It is useful for analyzing dependencies in a migration context, where cycles
 * can indicate circular dependencies between components or cartridges.<br/>
 * The <code>cartridgeCrumbs<code> collected by the <code>analyzeBuildFile(9<code>) 
 * method of the class @see KtsDependencyAnalyzer are gathered thiy way when building
 * a dependency tree.
 *  * 
 * The main method `hasCycles` returns true if cycles are found, and false otherwise.
 * 
 * createy with the help of Copoilot and ChatGPT.
